Firstly I use the circle as a primitive shape, extracted configuration inspiration from the leaf order, used the polar coordinate idea, created a dazzling visual effect through a large number of stacks of small primitives, and changed different color schemes.
Then I change the "alpha" and "shape", surprised to see amazing effects.
